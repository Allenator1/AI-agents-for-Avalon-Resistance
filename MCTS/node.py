'''
A class used to define nodes in the Monte Carlo tree, where the game state contains simultaneous actions
- i.e., when players are unable to observe the actions of other actors until all actions have been performed.
The selection process uses Decoupled UCT Selection (DUCT) to choose a child node. DUCT performs UCT independently
over each player's possible actions and constructs an optimal 'joint action', through which a child node is chosen.
